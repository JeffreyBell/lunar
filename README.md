# lunar

The first game I ever played was LUNUR.BAS on my high school's PDP-8/e.

There is an online version of the game at https://lunar69.uber.space/

I'm starting with the C port of the original focal game.  My plan is to
* Get rid of the gotos
* Modernize the variable names.
* Add the ability to input a program
* Add wrapper to search for better results.
